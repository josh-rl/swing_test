## Simple Yahtzee Game
- Uses Java Swing to implement the game of Yahtzee
with a friendly and easy to understand interface.
- Offline only (plans to implement local multiplayer in
the future)
- Virtual dice option only... real dice option coming soon

## How to use
- Visit the release section, have a Java runtime environment
installed, download the v0.3-beta jar file, run yahtzee.jar

## Source code
- Uses Intellij GUI designer.
- Could not find a pom plugin that supports this GUI
form designer for package compilation.
- Executable creation done through Intellij -> build artifact
